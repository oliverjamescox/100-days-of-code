# #100DaysOfCode Journal - Round 1

The journal of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on **June 5th, Friday, 2020**.

## Challenge Goals

* Beginner Level Topics (Syntax, Variables, Data Types etc)
* Intermediate Level Topics (Functions, Classes etc)

## Journal

### Day 1: June 5th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: [Understanding the Call stack](https://codepen.io/olivercoxdesign/full/vYLEQOj)

**Thoughts**: So I start #100DaysOfCode again.. I am opting to bend the rules slightly to remain motivated. Tweeting occasionally but for the first time keeping a journal using the #100DaysOfCode github repo. I have set up a couple of codepen templates to re-use for code snippets with most of my upcoming days planned for taking an aspect of JavaScript and breaking it down with practical examples. My goal is to really compound my vanilla JavaScript knowledge and have a body of work for reference by the end of it.

### Day 2: June 6th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: [Types of JavaScript](https://codepen.io/olivercoxdesign/full/pogJPRx)

**Thoughts**: Today I revisited JavaScript fundamentals looking at all of the various types, providing code snippets and analogies not just for my own reference but hopefully to be of use to others. I comprehend from a high level but I think I would benefit from practical examples and usecases to really compound my understanding.

**idea**: a codepen interactive quiz to test understanding of reference/value

**note**: see trello board about finding some reference/values examples in the wild

### Day 3: June 7th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: [Variables (var, let, const)](https://codepen.io/olivercoxdesign/full/QWybowY)

**Thoughts**: Quick blast exploring the types of JavaScript variables with a few practical examples, brushed over aspects such as hoisting and closures to cover them later down the line. I wanted to have a crack at the codepen challenge for this week but the day has escaped me.

**idea**: codepen challenge for GSAP sequences to animate the call stack as covered on Day 1

### Day 4: June 8th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: [JavaScript Operators - Part 1/?](https://codepen.io/olivercoxdesign/full/LYGpydV)

**Thoughts**: Full and productive day at work has left me a bit drained this evening, looked into Operators, I am finding the writing aspect time consuming and eating hours of my evening just for a simple high level rundown. I have split it across 2 days to make sure I have a concise rundown and really drill down into fundamentals.

---

### Day 5: June 9th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: [JavaScript Operators](https://codepen.io/olivercoxdesign/full/LYGpydV)

**Thoughts**: Another busy day but from tomorrow I will be back working on a Nuxt.js build with TailwindCSS for the rest of the week so looking forward to picking up where I left off. Continued with my Operators breakdown, initially spread across 2 pens but decided to instead consolidate down into 1, these initial pens feel almost like a regurgitation of official docs, I can't write it any better than the guys at MDN! still a useful rediscovery process. 

Eager to get onto areas I know I need to improve but have to respect the process and stick to the plan that I made for myself!

---

### Day 6: June 10th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: [== vs ===](https://codepen.io/olivercoxdesign/full/LYGGMdm)

**Thoughts**: Looked at strict vs loose equality checks, providing a quick rundown of the differences with examples. On this day I advised the use of === on all occasions, does my future self think different? 

With the release of the headless cms strapi's community edition I am going to spend the rest of the evening setting up a project.

---

### Day 7: June 11th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Reading & Codecademy Go app practice

**Thoughts**: Started reading the first book 'Get Started' of the second edition 'You Don't Know JS'. Going forward I am going to break the week up with a bit of reading along with the codepen concepts. Finding the Codecademy Go app really good for practice, presenting a overview of a concept followed up by a small test. I spent a bit of time on my strapi headless cms with a nuxt.js frontend but struggling with the routing to build out the blog content with the routing required.

---

### Day 8: June 12th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished reading YDKJS: Get Started (2nd edition)

**Thoughts**: Day away from a laptop and instead dedicated my time to reading, I have finished reading the first book in the 2nd editions of YDKJS, I didn't realise all the books weren't out yet, I may consider reading all of the 1st editions through and then approaching the 2nd editions when they are released. The book goes really into detail with my first pass through leaving some aspects confusing but something I will make a point of re-reading. Although I can follow the code and understand the steps I am struggling to see demonstratable use cases for such code (at the moment anyway) to really give me those lightbulb moments.

---

### Day 9: June 13th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Strings concatenation & coercion (Codepen) and continued reading

**Thoughts**: Started reading [javascript.info](https://javascript.info) and going to do codepens on core topics, today exploring string concatenation.

### Day 10: June 14th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Codecademy Go practice & reading

**Thoughts**: Really enjoying Codecademy Go app, shame it doesn't track progress, at least I can focus on key areas. Unusual lightbulb moment with vanilla javascript, assigning what a function returns to a variable. Revisiting fundamentals I have been trying to go into greater detail asking why. Continued reading through [javascript.info](https://javascript.info) finishing up the fundamentals section.

---

### Day 11: June 15th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Codecademy Go practice, there are a couple of gotchas in there!

---

### Day 12: June 16th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Reading the [javascript.info](https://javascript.info) fundamentals section and started reading the code quality section, touched on mocha but little interest in this at the moment.

---

### Day 13: June 17th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up code quality section and dove into the next, objects! always reached for dot notation but saw the merits of bracket notation and keen to try them out. Codecademy Go practice as usual, is a daily staple of mine. Really enjoying the app.

---

### Day 14: June 18th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Actually sat and wrote some javascript to play around with objects and work on the tasks at the end of the first objects section. Actually forgot to do my Codecademy Practice and broke my streak!

---

### Day 15: June 19th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the objects tasks and went back over the previously read sections tasks and started working through those. Current progress upto "2.11 - Logical Operators". Numeric conversions are strange.. for example null becomes 0, undefined becomes NaN and an empty string i.e "" becomes 0.
