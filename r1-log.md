**Thoughts**: So I start #100DaysOfCode again.. I am opting to bend the rules slightly to remain motivated. Tweeting occasionally but for the first time keeping a journal using the #100DaysOfCode github repo. I have set up a couple of codepen templates to re-use for code snippets with most of my upcoming days planned for taking an aspect of JavaScript and breaking it down with practical examples. My goal is to really compound my vanilla JavaScript knowledge and have a body of work for reference by the end of it.
