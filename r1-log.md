# #100DaysOfCode Journal - Round 1

The journal of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on **June 5th, Friday, 2020**.

## Challenge Goals

* Beginner Level Topics (Syntax, Variables, Data Types etc)
* Intermediate Level Topics (Functions, Classes etc)

## Journal

### Day 1: June 5th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: [Understanding the Call stack](https://codepen.io/olivercoxdesign/full/vYLEQOj)

**Thoughts**: So I start #100DaysOfCode again.. I am opting to bend the rules slightly to remain motivated. Tweeting occasionally but for the first time keeping a journal using the #100DaysOfCode github repo. I have set up a couple of codepen templates to re-use for code snippets with most of my upcoming days planned for taking an aspect of JavaScript and breaking it down with practical examples. My goal is to really compound my vanilla JavaScript knowledge and have a body of work for reference by the end of it.

### Day 2: June 6th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: [Types of JavaScript](https://codepen.io/olivercoxdesign/full/pogJPRx)

**Thoughts**: Today I revisited JavaScript fundamentals looking at all of the various types, providing code snippets and analogies not just for my own reference but hopefully to be of use to others. I comprehend from a high level but I think I would benefit from practical examples and usecases to really compound my understanding.

**idea**: a codepen interactive quiz to test understanding of reference/value

**note**: see trello board about finding some reference/values examples in the wild

### Day 3: June 7th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: [Variables (var, let, const)](https://codepen.io/olivercoxdesign/full/QWybowY)

**Thoughts**: Quick blast exploring the types of JavaScript variables with a few practical examples, brushed over aspects such as hoisting and closures to cover them later down the line. I wanted to have a crack at the codepen challenge for this week but the day has escaped me.

**idea**: codepen challenge for GSAP sequences to animate the call stack as covered on Day 1

### Day 4: June 8th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: [JavaScript Operators - Part 1/?](https://codepen.io/olivercoxdesign/full/LYGpydV)

**Thoughts**: Full and productive day at work has left me a bit drained this evening, looked into Operators, I am finding the writing aspect time consuming and eating hours of my evening just for a simple high level rundown. I have split it across ~~2~~ days to make sure I have a concise rundown and really drill down into fundamentals.

**idea** ~~I may consider adding in days of no writing to revisit topics covered and just create practical examples in codepen.~~ I am extending operators by however many days it takes and focusing on a key aspect per day. i.e destructuring, ternary operators etc.
